A Research Agent is an AI system designed to assist with academic and scientific research tasks. It can 
autonomously search for literature, summarize papers, and organize references. Using natural language 
processing, it understands research questions and retrieves relevant information. The agent can generate 
reports, suggest hypotheses, and even draft sections of research papers. It saves time by automating repetitive 
tasks like citation management and data extraction. Research Agents enhance efficiency, accuracy, and 
innovation in both academic and industrial R&D.
